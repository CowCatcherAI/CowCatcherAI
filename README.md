### Helping with Estrus Detection for Modern Dairy Farming

**CowCatcher AI** is an informative open-source computer vision model designed to monitor your herd 24/7. By analyzing live footage from your barn cameras, it automatically detects "mounting" behavior—the primary sign of estrus (heat)—and instantly sends a photo notification to your smartphone via Telegram or combine it with your Home assistant setup.
